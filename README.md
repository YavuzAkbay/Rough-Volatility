# üß† Enhanced Rough Volatility Analysis with AI

A Python implementation for analyzing financial volatility using rough volatility models enhanced with deep learning techniques. This project combines traditional rough volatility theory with modern AI approaches to provide advanced volatility forecasting and risk analysis.

## üöÄ Features

- Rough Volatility Modeling: Implementation of multiple Hurst parameter estimates (H=0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) for comprehensive rough volatility analysis
- AI-Powered Predictions: Enhanced LSTM neural network with attention mechanisms for volatility forecasting
- Multi-Feature Engineering: Comprehensive feature set including technical indicators, GARCH volatility, and rough volatility estimates
- Advanced Risk Analytics: VaR calculations, volatility regime detection, and risk distribution analysis

## üìä Model Architecture

- Bidirectional LSTM layers with dropout regularization
- Multi-head attention mechanism (16 heads) for enhanced pattern recognition
- Batch normalization and LeakyReLU activation for stable training
- Adaptive learning rate scheduling with OneCycleLR

### Key Components

1. Bidirectional LSTM: Enhanced with multi-head attention for capturing complex temporal dependencies
2. Data Augmentation: Noise injection and time warping for robust model training
3. Combined Loss Function: MSE + Huber loss for improved prediction accuracy
4. Comprehensive Visualizations: 9-panel dashboard with training progress, predictions, and risk metrics

## üìà Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from roughvolatility import EnhancedRoughVolatilityAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = EnhancedRoughVolatilityAnalyzer(
    sequence_length=60,
    prediction_horizon=5
)

# Analyze a stock
data, predictions, actual = analyzer.analyze_enhanced_rough_volatility(
    ticker="AAPL",
    start_date='2020-01-01'
)

```

### Custom Configuration

```python
# Advanced configuration
analyzer = EnhancedRoughVolatilityAnalyzer(
    sequence_length=120,  # Longer sequences for more context
    prediction_horizon=10  # Predict further ahead
)

# Multiple stock analysis
tickers = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "TSLA"]
for ticker in tickers:
    analyzer.analyze_enhanced_rough_volatility(ticker)
```

## üìä Model Output

The system provides comprehensive analysis including:

### Volatility Metrics
1. Current predicted volatility
2. Average volatility trends
3. Volatility regime classification (High/Low/Moderate)

### AI Investment Recommendations
- High Volatility Alert: Reduce positions, consider protective strategies
- Low Volatility Opportunity: Increase positions, momentum strategies
- Moderate Volatility: Maintain balanced allocation

### Visual Dashboard
- Stock Price Chart: Recent price movements
- Training Progress: Model loss convergence
- Prediction Accuracy: AI vs actual volatility
- Scatter Plot: Prediction correlation analysis
- Rough Volatility Estimates: Multiple Hurst parameters
- Feature Importance: Model interpretation
- Volatility Regimes: Risk level detection
- Risk Distribution: VaR analysis with historical returns
- Forecast Horizon: Future volatility predictions

## üßÆ Technical Implementation

The system calculates rough volatility using fractional kernel convolution:

```python
kernel = np.array([(k+1)**(H-1.5) for k in range(lags)])
rough_vol = np.convolve(abs_returns, kernel_normalized, mode='same')
```
## üìä Performance Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Primary accuracy metric
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Robust error measurement
- Model Accuracy: Percentage accuracy calculation
- Volatility Trend Detection: Direction and magnitude analysis

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Risk Management**: Portfolio volatility forecasting, VaR calculations and stress testing, dynamic hedging strategy optimization.
- **Trading Strategies**: Volatility regime-based position sizing, options trading signal generation, market timing for risk-on/risk-off strategies.
- **Research Applications**: Rough volatility model validation, market microstructure analysis, behavioral finance studies.
